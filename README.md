# About

GitLab-CI runner nodes

This is to be used after [rgl/gitlab-vagrant](https://github.com/rgl/gitlab-vagrant) is running.

This is analogous to Jenkins slave nodes of the [rgl/jenkins-vagrant](https://github.com/rgl/jenkins-vagrant) environment, but using GitLab-CI instead of Jenkins.

This includes:

* `ubuntu` node:
  * `shell` runner.
    * Docker and Docker Compose.
    * Bash.
    * PowerShell.
    * .NET SDK.
  * `docker` runner.
    * Runs jobs in ephemeral application containers.
* `incus` node:
  * `incus` runner.
    * Docker and Docker Compose.
    * Runs jobs in ephemeral system containers.
* `windows` node:
  * `shell` runner.
    * Docker and Docker Compose.
    * PowerShell.
    * .NET SDK.
    * Visual Studio Build Tools.
  * `docker` runner.
    * Runs jobs in ephemeral application containers.

# Usage

From the `../gitlab-vagrant` directory, start GitLab as described at [rgl/gitlab-vagrant](https://github.com/rgl/gitlab-vagrant).

At this repository directory, start the runner nodes:

```bash
vagrant up --no-destroy-on-error ubuntu
vagrant up --no-destroy-on-error incus
vagrant up --no-destroy-on-error windows
```

List this repository dependencies (and which have newer versions):

```bash
export GITHUB_COM_TOKEN='YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_TOKEN'
./renovate.sh
```
